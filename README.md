# website-assignment-
A website assignment I did for university

It features many website functionalities (videos, images, text, sound, buttons), formed in a basic structure, while it is also has a very good aesthetic, taking into consideration that it is my first fully working (locally) website I ever made. 
The site is presenting an music artist (The Weeknd) using html, css, javascript, php, sql. Each visitor can rate each one of weeknd albums and its gvote is saved into a database and depending the ranking of each person, a new general rankning of each album is generated. In addition, each visitor can take part into a contest of winning free tickets to the show.

An issue it has is that of responsivness as it works fine on big screens only (>27inch) due to the short period given to make it (10 days)

note: A part of the site is in Greek as I stdy in Greece.
