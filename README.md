This is a website assignment I created from scratch for my university, without using any built-in components. The site features many functionalities, including videos, images, text, sound, and buttons, and has a basic structure with a good aesthetic. It is the first fully working website I have ever made locally.

The website presents the music artist The Weeknd, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. Each visitor can rate each one of The Weeknd's albums, and their vote is saved into a database. Depending on the ranking, a new general ranking of each album is generated. Additionally, visitors can take part in a contest to win free tickets to The Weeknd's show.

One issue the website has is with responsiveness. It works fine on larger screens only (>27 inches) due to the short period of time given to complete the project (10 days).

Note: Parts of the website are in Greek as I am studying in Greece. Additionally, some images may be copyrighted, but they are only used for educational and personal reasons. Finally, the contest is for a specific show, which should be specified.
